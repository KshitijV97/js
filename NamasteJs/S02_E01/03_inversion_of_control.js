// Inversion of control

// We lose the control of our code when we are using callbacks

// We are trusting functions to call other functions

// The function we passed as callback may never be called or be called multiple times

// We are giving the control of one piece of code to other piece of code

// async programming in JS exists because callbacks exist

/**
 * Issues with callbacks
 * 1. Callback hell
 * 2. Inversion of control

Stack and heap

Array - Start to center

Heap - End to center

Storing whole arrays in stack frame does not make sense

Stack frame does not change size

Arrays are stored in Heap

Variables in the stack frame can reference Objects and arrays in the heap and then those objects and ararys in the heap can in turn access other objects and ararys in the heap
